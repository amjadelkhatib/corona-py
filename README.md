# corona.py

> Wow I really want to write a Python script that tells me how many people have died of COVID-19

*â€“ nobody ever*

## How to Use

Throw the file into your project directory and install the dependencies. I'm not putting this up on PiPy because I'm lazy.

### Dependencies

This project requires BeautifulSoup 4 (an HTML parsing library) and `requests`. You can install both using the commands below

```bash
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install requests
```

### Examples

```python
import corona # ...into your country

world_data = corona.fetch_world_data()
ded = world_data.get_country('usa').deaths
print("oh no", ded, "people have died in the US very sad")
```

```python
import corona
print(corona.fetch_global_data().world.infected, "people around the world are currently infected with COVID-19")
```

## Documentation

### `corona.fetch_world_data()`

Returns a `DiseaseData` object

### `DiseaseData`

Properties:

- `infected_countries`: a list of infected countries by country code

The country code is usually just the name of the country, but lowercase and underscored. For a list of country codes, print out `DiseaseData.infected_countries`
